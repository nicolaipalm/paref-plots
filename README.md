In this module we demonstrate the effectiveness of Pareto reflections 
in the context of multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems on exemplary base.
We consider standard test functions and apply problem tailored MOO algorithms 
implemented in the [Paref](https://github.com/nicolaipalm/paref) package.

Simply install the requirements by 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and run the algorithms in the `algorithms` module.
